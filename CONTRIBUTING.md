# Contributing to Engram

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghost-Frame/Engram.git
cd Engram
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Rust 1.94 or later. The workspace builds on Linux, macOS, and WSL2. Native Windows builds are untested -- use WSL2.

### System Dependencies

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev clang protobuf-compiler
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install openssl protobuf
```

SQLite is vendored via `rusqlite` (bundled feature). SQLCipher is vendored at compile time -- no system libsqlcipher needed.

## Workspace Structure

```
engram-rust/
  engram-lib/           Core library -- all domain logic lives here
  engram-server/        HTTP API server (Axum)
  engram-cli/           CLI client over the HTTP API
  engram-sidecar/       Session-scoped memory proxy
  engram-mcp/           MCP server (Model Context Protocol)
  engram-cred/          Credential management library
  engram-credd/         Credential management daemon
  engram-approval-tui/  Approval workflow TUI (WIP)
  engram-migrate/       libsql -> rusqlite ETL tool
  agent-forge/          Structured reasoning CLI
  sdk/                  Client SDKs (TypeScript)
  hooks/                Claude Code hook scripts
```

**Key rule:** domain logic goes in `engram-lib`. Server routes go in `engram-server`. Don't put business logic in the server crate.

## Development Workflow

### Before You Code

1. Check existing issues -- someone might already be working on it
2. Open an issue first for significant changes -- lets us discuss the approach before you invest time
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` -- contains workspace conventions, import paths, and patterns

### While Coding

```bash
# Verify it compiles after every change
cargo check --workspace

# Run tests (in-memory SQLite, no external deps)
cargo test --workspace

# Lint before committing -- warnings are errors
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- No em dashes in comments, docs, or commit messages -- use `--` or rewrite the sentence
- Prefer surgical edits over large rewrites
- Don't add features beyond what's asked
- Don't add speculative abstractions
- New modules must be declared in the parent `mod.rs` with `pub mod`
- DTOs and request/response types go in `types.rs` within each module

### Commit Messages

- One logical change per commit
- Present tense, imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- First line under 72 characters
- Reference issues when applicable: "fix memory leak in search (#42)"

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
5. Run `cargo test --workspace`
6. Push and open a PR

### PR Checklist

- [ ] `cargo check --workspace` passes
- [ ] `cargo clippy --workspace` passes with no warnings
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes
- [ ] New code has tests where applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changes
- [ ] No unrelated changes in the PR

## Testing

Tests use in-memory SQLite -- no database setup needed. Each test gets isolated state.

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_search_returns_recent_memories_first() {
    let db = Database::connect_memory().await.unwrap();
    // ... test logic
}
```

- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests
- Name tests descriptively: `test_search_returns_recent_memories_first`
- Tests run with `cargo test --workspace` -- no feature flags needed

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong import paths** -- check `engram-lib/src/lib.rs` for what's exported
2. **Forgetting `pub mod`** -- new modules must be declared in parent `mod.rs`
3. **Moving out of borrows** -- use `.clone()` or restructure; the compiler tells you exactly what's wrong
4. **Missing Cargo.toml deps** -- add workspace deps before using them
5. **Not running cargo check** -- Rust errors are precise; read them before asking for help
6. **Feature-gated code** -- the `brain` module requires `brain_hopfield` feature flag
