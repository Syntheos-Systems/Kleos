## Why Rust?

Engram started as a Node.js server. It worked. But a memory system that injects into every agent turn has to stay fast under load, and Node made that harder than it should have been.

This is the ground-up Rust rewrite. Same cognitive model, same API surface, same data format. Different runtime.

- **Single static binary.** `cargo build --release` gives you one file. No Node, no `node_modules`, no flags.
- **Tokio + Axum.** Async from the socket down to SQLite. Thousands of concurrent agent requests on a small VPS.
- **In-process ONNX.** `ort` runs embeddings and the cross-encoder reranker inside the server process. No Python, no worker threads, no sidecar model server.
- **SQLite + LanceDB.** rusqlite (with optional SQLCipher) holds relational memory and FTS5. LanceDB holds the vector index once the corpus outgrows memory.
- **One workspace.** Library, server, CLI, MCP, sidecar, and credential manager build from one `cargo` command.

One binary. One SQLite database. Local embeddings. No cloud keys required. Your hardware, your data.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghost-Frame/Engram.git && cd Engram
cargo build --release
./target/release/engram-server
```

Server binds to `127.0.0.1:4200` by default. Bootstrap an admin key, then store and search:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4200/bootstrap \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "admin"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:4200/store \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Production DB is PostgreSQL 16 on db.example.com:5432", "category": "reference"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:4200/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eg_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "database connection info"}'
```

MCP stdio entrypoint:

```bash
ENGRAM_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN=eg_... cargo run -p engram-mcp
```

## Features

- **FSRS-6 Spaced Repetition.** Memories strengthen with use and fade when ignored. Power-law forgetting with trained parameters.
- **4-Channel Hybrid Search.** Vector similarity, FTS5 full-text, personality signals, and graph traversal fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
- **Knowledge Graph.** Auto-linking, Louvain community detection, weighted PageRank, cooccurrence, structural analysis.
- **Personality Engine.** Preferences, values, motivations, identity. Every recall shapes around who the agent is talking to.
- **Self-Hosted.** One Rust binary. One SQLite database. Local ONNX embeddings. No cloud keys.
- **Encryption at Rest.** SQLCipher database encryption with keyfile, environment variable, or YubiKey HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response.
- **Atomic Fact Decomposition.** Long memories split into self-contained facts. Each fact links back to its parent via `has_fact`.
- **Contradiction Detection.** When agents learn conflicting information, Engram surfaces the conflict.
- **Guardrails.** The gate system checks commands before agents act. Stored rules return allow/warn/block on proposed actions, with optional human-in-the-loop approval.
- **Episodic Memory.** Conversation episodes stored as searchable narratives.
- **Bulk Ingestion.** 11 parsers: Markdown, PDF, HTML, DOCX, CSV, JSONL, ZIP archives, ChatGPT exports, Claude exports, and raw message formats through the async ingestion pipeline.
- **LanceDB Vector Index.** Optional ANN backend for large corpora. Small tenants fall back to in-memory scan.
- **Claude Code Hooks.** Ready-to-use hooks for session memory, context injection, and tool tracking. See [`hooks/README.md`](hooks/README.md).

- **Versioning**: update memories without losing history, full version chain preserved per user
- **Auto-Deduplication**: SimHash 64-bit locality-sensitive hashing catches near-identical memories
- **Auto-Forget / TTL**: set memories to expire, background sweep via async job worker

### Intelligence Layer
- **Fact Extraction**: structured facts with temporal validity windows (`valid_at`, `invalid_at`)
- **Conversation Extraction**: feed raw chat logs, get structured memories
- **Reflections & Consolidation**: meta-analysis and cluster compression, non-destructive
- **Causal and Valence**: detect cause/effect links and emotional charge on new memories
- **Growth**: self-improving observations from agent activity, stored as growth memories
- **Sentiment Analysis**: emotional tone detection on stored content
- **Predictive**: anticipatory memory retrieval based on usage patterns
- **Reconsolidation**: update existing memory traces when new evidence arrives

### Developer Platform
- **REST API**: 80+ endpoints across 40+ route modules
- **Rust CLI**: `engram-cli` for store, search, context, recall, list, bootstrap, and credential management
- **MCP Server**: `engram-mcp` for LLM tool integration via Model Context Protocol (stdio; HTTP behind feature flag)

- **Audit Trail**: every mutation logged with who, what, when, from where
- **Scratchpad**: ephemeral working memory with TTL auto-purge

### Coordination Services

Engram bundles a set of coordination services behind the same auth and database:

- **Axon**: event bus with channels, subscriptions, SSE streaming, cursor polling
- **Brain**: cross-service orchestration primitives, Hopfield networks, spreading activation (feature-gated: `brain_hopfield`)
- **Broca**: structured action log with auto-narration
- **Chiasm**: task tracking with audit trails
- **Loom**: workflow orchestration with step callbacks
- **Soma**: agent registry, heartbeats, capability search, groups
- **Thymus**: rubric-driven quality evaluation and metrics

### Cognitive Layer (Cognithor)
- **Context Routing**: intelligent routing of queries to the right retrieval pipeline
- **Compression**: context compression for token-efficient prompt assembly
- **Tactical**: tactical planning for multi-step retrieval
- **Weight Optimization**: dynamic weight tuning for search channel fusion

### Organization
- **Graph Endpoints**: full memory graph (nodes + edges), timeline, community browse
- **Entities & Projects**: people, servers, tools, projects
- **Review Queue / Inbox**: approve, reject, or edit before memories enter recall
- **Community Detection**: Louvain algorithm surfaces memory clusters

<details>
<summary><strong>Architecture</strong></summary>

### Runtime Stack

- **Server**: Axum 0.8 on Tokio, `tower-http` for tracing, CORS, compression (gzip/br/zstd), timeouts
- **Database**: rusqlite with FTS5 and optional SQLCipher encryption, behind a deadpool async connection pool
- **Vector index**: LanceDB (optional, toggled via `use_lance_index`)
- **Embeddings**: BAAI/bge-m3, 1024-dim, ONNX via `ort` with the `tokenizers` crate. Deferred background loading with pre-warm.
- **Reranker**: IBM granite-embedding-reranker-english-r2 INT8 cross-encoder (optional, deferred loading)
- **Decay**: FSRS-6 with trained parameters and power-law forgetting
- **LLM**: optional. Ollama (OpenAI-compatible endpoint) for fact extraction, decomposition, consolidation, growth reflection. Env vars: `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL`. Circuit breaker with configurable threshold and cooldown.
- **Allocator**: mimalloc global allocator
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry tracing + Prometheus metrics endpoint

### Search Pipeline

Every query fans out across four channels, then merges via Reciprocal Rank Fusion:

1. **Vector similarity**: cosine against bge-m3 embeddings. LanceDB ANN when enabled, in-memory scan otherwise.
2. **FTS5 full-text**: BM25 across content and tags.
3. **Personality signals**: match against extracted preferences, values, identity markers.
4. **Graph relationships**: 2-hop traversal weighted by edge type and PageRank.

Question-type detection (fact recall, preference, reasoning, generalization, timeline) reweights the channels before scoring. The ONNX cross-encoder reranks the top-K for semantic precision.

### Memory Lifecycle

1. **Store**: SimHash checks for near-duplicates. Unique memories get embedded by `ort` and written to SQLite with FTS5 indexing and an optional LanceDB insert.
2. **Auto-link**: the new memory gets compared against existing ones via cosine similarity. Typed edges form: similarity, updates, extends, contradicts, caused_by, prerequisite_for.
3. **FSRS-6 init**: each memory receives starting stability, difficulty, storage strength, retrieval strength.
4. **Fact extraction**: when Ollama is configured, structured facts get pulled with temporal validity windows.
5. **Atomic decomposition**: long memories split into self-contained facts linked to the parent via `has_fact`. The parent stays intact.
6. **Entity cooccurrence**: entities in the same memory update the weighted cooccurrence graph.
7. **Personality extraction**: six signal types scanned: preference, value, motivation, decision, emotion, identity.
8. **Recall**: RRF fuses four channels. Every recalled memory receives an implicit FSRS review graded "Good".
9. **Spaced repetition**: archived or forgotten memories receive "Again". Stable memories can reach months or years between reviews.
10. **Dual-strength decay**: storage strength accumulates. Retrieval strength decays via power law.
11. **Community detection and PageRank**: background workers rerun Louvain grouping and weighted PageRank on a schedule and on dirty-edge thresholds.

### Server Startup

The server initializes in a specific order:

1. Load config (TOML file + env var overrides)
2. Install Prometheus metrics recorder
3. Resolve encryption key (none/keyfile/env/yubikey)
4. Connect to database with optional SQLCipher
5. Spawn background model loading (embedder + reranker -- server starts serving immediately, models load async)
6. Probe local LLM (Ollama) -- graceful degradation if unavailable
7. Initialize brain backend (feature-gated)
8. Check for crash-looping (safe mode activates after 3+ restarts in 5 minutes)
9. Start background tasks: PageRank refresh, auto-checkpoint, job cleanup, vector sync replay, auto-backup

### Security

- `user_id` scoping on every query, including parent lookups during versioning
- Transactional store/update paths with forward-compatible migrations
- FTS5 query sanitization against DoS and injection
- Rate limiting layered inside auth so the limiter sees the resolved tenant
- Pre-auth rate limiting to prevent brute-force
- Bearer-token auth with scope enforcement and audit logging on every mutation
- JSON depth limiting to prevent stack-bomb payloads
- Request body size limit (2 MiB default)
- Request timeout (120s default, tighter per-route: health 1s, search 10s, context 30s)
- Response hardening headers: nosniff, DENY framing, no-referrer, HSTS, no cross-domain policies
- CORS restricted by default (explicit `ENGRAM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` required for cross-origin access)
- Safe mode: automatic write-blocking after crash-loop detection

</details>

<a id="cli"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>CLI</strong></summary>

`engram-cli` wraps the HTTP API. Same workspace, same build.

```bash
cargo build --release -p engram-cli
# or
cargo run -p engram-cli -- --help
```

```bash
export ENGRAM_URL=http://localhost:4200
export ENGRAM_API_KEY=eg_your_key
```

```bash
engram-cli store "Deployed auth migration to production" --category state --importance 0.9
engram-cli search "deployment history" --limit 5
engram-cli context "current infrastructure state" --limit 5
engram-cli recall 42
engram-cli list --limit 20
engram-cli delete 42
engram-cli bootstrap
```

### Credential Management (via credd)

```bash
engram-cli cred get <category> <name>          # get a secret
engram-cli cred get <category> <name> --raw    # raw value only
engram-cli cred set <category> <name>          # set (prompted for value)
engram-cli cred list                           # list all secrets
engram-cli cred delete <category> <name>       # delete
engram-cli cred agent-create <name>            # create agent key
engram-cli cred agent-list                     # list agent keys
engram-cli cred agent-revoke <name>            # revoke agent key
```

Every command takes `--server` and `--key` overrides, or reads `ENGRAM_URL` / `ENGRAM_API_KEY` from the environment. Credential commands talk to the credd daemon at `CREDD_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:4400`).

</details>

<a id="sidecar"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Sidecar</strong></summary>

`engram-sidecar` runs next to a single agent session. It proxies requests to the main Engram server while providing:

- **Session-scoped context** with local caching for fast recall
- **File watcher** for Claude Code session JSONL files (auto-extracts memories)
- **Batched observation flushing** -- configurable by count (`--batch-size`) and time (`--batch-interval-ms`)
- **Persistent session store** -- optional SQLite-backed session persistence (`--store-path`)
- **Shared-secret auth** -- auto-generated or explicit token for sidecar access
- **Local LLM integration** -- Ollama probe for conversation compression

```bash
ENGRAM_URL=http://localhost:4200 \
ENGRAM_API_KEY=eg_your_key \
engram-sidecar --engram-url http://localhost:4200 --watch
```

Default port: `7711`. The sidecar is a lightweight HTTP service that talks to `engram-server` for storage and search. It doesn't run embeddings locally.

</details>

<a id="configuration"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>

Configuration is layered: defaults -> TOML file -> environment variable overrides. Env vars always win.

TOML config is loaded from (in order): `ENGRAM_CONFIG_FILE` env var, `./engram.toml` in CWD, or `~/.config/engram/config.toml`.

| `ENGRAM_RERANKER_TOP_K` | `12` | Rerank top K candidates |
| `ENGRAM_USE_LANCE_INDEX` | `1` | Set `0` to disable the LanceDB vector backend |

### LLM (Ollama)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions` | Ollama OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

| `ENGRAM_BACKUP_DIR` | `backups` | Backup directory (relative to data_dir) |
| `ENGRAM_BACKUP_RETENTION` | `14` | Max hourly backup files to retain |
| `ENGRAM_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAILY` | `30` | Max daily backup files to retain |

### Encryption at Rest

Encryption is **off by default**. Engram runs with a plain SQLite database out of the box. To enable SQLCipher encryption, set `ENGRAM_ENCRYPTION_MODE` to one of:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `none` | No encryption (default). Database opens without `PRAGMA key`. |
| `keyfile` | Read a 32-byte raw key from `~/.config/engram/dbkey`. File must be `chmod 600` on Unix. |
| `env` | Read `ENGRAM_DB_KEY` environment variable (64 hex characters = 32 bytes). |
| `yubikey` | Derive key from YubiKey HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response (slot 2) via Argon2id. |

**Keyfile setup:**

```bash
head -c 32 /dev/urandom > ~/.config/engram/dbkey
chmod 600 ~/.config/engram/dbkey
ENGRAM_ENCRYPTION_MODE=keyfile engram-server
```

**Environment variable setup:**

```bash
export ENGRAM_DB_KEY=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | xxd -p -c 64)
ENGRAM_ENCRYPTION_MODE=env engram-server
```

**YubiKey setup:**

YubiKey mode uses HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response (slot 2) to derive the encryption key via Argon2id. The YubiKey must be present to unlock the database. Cold starts take about 1 second (64 MiB memory, 3 iterations). Once unlocked, the key stays in memory until the process exits.

```bash
ykman otp chalresp --generate 2
engram-credd --encryption-mode yubikey
ENGRAM_ENCRYPTION_MODE=yubikey engram-server
```

### Security

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENGRAM_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | unset | Comma-separated IPs of trusted reverse proxies (for X-Forwarded-For) |
| `ENGRAM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | unset | Comma-separated origins for CORS (restricted by default) |
| `ENGRAM_AUTH_KEY_ROTATION_GRACE_HOURS` | `24` | Grace period for old key after rotation |

See `engram-lib/src/config.rs` for the full set, including Eidolon, gate, growth, sessions, and prompt configuration.
